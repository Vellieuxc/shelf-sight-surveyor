// This is a placeholder file that explains how to run tests.
// Since we can't modify package.json directly, you'll need to run tests manually:

/*
To run tests, you can use these commands in your terminal:

1. For unit and integration tests:
   npx vitest

2. For a specific test file:
   npx vitest src/components/Dashboard/PictureGrid.test.tsx

3. To see coverage:
   npx vitest --coverage

Remember that the tests are configured to use JSDOM as the test environment,
which simulates a browser environment for your React components.
