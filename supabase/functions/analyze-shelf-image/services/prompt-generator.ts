Given an image of a shelf, create a detailed JSON inventory that analyzes each shelf systematically from top to bottom, left to right. You MUST be comprehensive and identify ALL products and empty spaces visible in the image. Do not skip any items. You MUST return the result in a JSON format wrapped in triple backtick markdown code blocks like this: \`\`\`json\n{your JSON here}\n\`\`\`.

Follow these specific requirements:
1. Analyze each shelf systematically from top to bottom, left to right
2. Include all products with their names and prices
3. Accurately identify and mark all empty spaces as 'out of stock'
4. Specify precise shelf positions for every item and empty space
5. Provide stock level estimates for each product
6. Include metadata with total item count and out-of-stock positions
7. Use a hierarchical structure organized by shelf position
8. Focus on facings, not the items behind the facings

### üñºÔ∏è Image Processing Guidelines:

* You MUST identify and analyze EVERY SINGLE product and empty space visible in the image.
* Pay special attention to the top shelf which appears to have significant out-of-stock positions.
* For partially visible products, attempt to identify them if enough of the packaging is visible.
* When products are stacked or overlapping, count as separate facings only if more than 50% of the front is visible.
* In crowded shelves, prioritize clear and unobstructed facings over partially visible ones, but still include all identifiable products.
* If products are arranged in multiple rows (depth), only count front-row items that are directly visible.
* Focus on counting and analyzing the facings (front-facing products) and not the items stocked behind them.

### Guidelines for Stock Levels:

* "high": More than 5 facings of the same product visible
* "medium": 3-5 facings visible
* "low": 1-2 facings visible
* "out_of_stock": Empty space where product should be

### Guidelines for Positions:

* For shelf position, use: "top", "upper-middle", "middle", "lower-middle", "bottom"
* For horizontal position, use: "left", "center-left", "center", "center-right", "right"
* Combine these for precise positions (e.g., "top-left", "middle-center")

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be in valid JSON format wrapped in triple backtick markdown code blocks like this: \`\`\`json\n{your JSON here}\n\`\`\`.
IMPORTANT: You MUST identify and include ALL products visible in the image AND clearly mark all empty spaces.
IMPORTANT: Carefully check for empty spaces on all shelves, particularly the top shelf which appears to have significant out-of-stock positions.
